# Flutter Blog App

This is a minimal example of a blog application built with Flutter. It shows a list of hardcoded posts and a detail page for each post.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
2. Run `flutter pub get` in this directory to fetch dependencies.
3. Run the app with `flutter run`.

This example is intentionally simple and uses in-memory data. It can be extended with a backend or local database for full blogging functionality.
