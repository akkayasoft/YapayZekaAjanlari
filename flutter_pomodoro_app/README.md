# Flutter Pomodoro App

This is a minimal Pomodoro timer built with Flutter. It starts with a 25 minute countdown that can be started, paused and reset.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
2. Run `flutter pub get` in this directory to fetch dependencies.
3. Start the app with `flutter run`.

This example is intentionally simple and keeps state in memory. You can extend it with notifications, persistent state or custom work/break intervals.
